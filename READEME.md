## 8 Bit Minecraft Computer Virtual Machine

This project is a Virtual Machine to logically emulate my 8 Bit Minecraft Computer, which is based on real computational concepts.

### Objectives:

- Create an Assembler for my customized Instruction Set Architecture [ISA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ce8okA9Iy8wLN9gtn3IzqqO52bT0SPEkzZ5C6IkLoVc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

- Run programs based on the assembled Machine code

- Emulate the states and content of every component

- Run programs in Debug mode
